# Welcome to the speed fine calculator!
# The goal of this program is to calculate the speed limit and clocked speed 
# for a perosn who is driving and determine if the driver should receive a fine or not.
# First, the user must enter a speed limit.
# Second, the user must enter a clocked speed.
# Once the user enters a speed limit and clocked speed, the program will
# determine if the driver will receive no fine, receive a fine, or if their speed is legal.
# If the user enters a clocked speed that's less than the limit speed, then 
# the program will print "No Fine"
# Next, if the user enters a clocked speed that is greater than the limit speed
# and the clocked speed is less than 90, the program will print "Fine"
# If the user enters a clocked speed that is above 90, the program will print "Speed is legal"
